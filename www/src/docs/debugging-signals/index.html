					If you're having a tough time tracing an issue, you can provide the <th-code>debugMode</th-code> option to any
					signal to log potentially helpful information to the console. For differentiating values, you can also provide
					an optional <th-code>label</th-code> property to easily associate logs with their respective sources. These
					options can be passed to signals themselves, or to specific calls to setters and getters.
