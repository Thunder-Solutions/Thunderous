					Thunderous follows <th-link href="https://semver.org">Semantic Versioning</th-link>, which means that the
					version number indicates the nature of the changes in the release. The version number is formatted as
					<th-code>MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH</th-code>, where: <th-code>MAJOR</th-code> is incremented for incompatible API
					changes, <th-code>MINOR</th-code> is incremented for added functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and
					<th-code>PATCH</th-code> is incremented for backwards-compatible bug fixes.
