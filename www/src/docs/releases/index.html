					Thunderous follows <th-link href="https://semver.org">Semantic Versioning</th-link>, which means that the
					version number indicates the nature of the changes in the release. The version number is formatted as
					<th-code>MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH</th-code>, where: <th-code>MAJOR</th-code> is incremented for incompatible API
					changes, <th-code>MINOR</th-code> is incremented for added functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and
					<th-code>PATCH</th-code> is incremented for backwards-compatible bug fixes.

				<ul>
					<li>
						<th-content-group>
							<th-text> <th-code>2.3.12</th-code> (Latest)</th-text>
							<th-content-group>
								<th-text>
									Fixed boolean coercion in attributes-as-properties, so that now empty strings are coerced to
									<th-code>true</th-code> while both the string <th-code>'false'</th-code> and
									<th-code>null</th-code> are coerced to <th-code>false</th-code>.
								</th-text>
							</th-content-group>
						</th-content-group>
					</li>
					<li>
						<th-content-group>
							<th-text> <th-code>2.3.11</th-code> </th-text>
							<th-content-group>
								<th-text>
									Fixed boolean attributes-as-properties so that false values remove the attribute from the DOM, and
									true adds an attribute with an empty value.
								</th-text>
							</th-content-group>
						</th-content-group>
					</li>
					<li>
						<th-content-group>
							<th-text> <th-code>2.3.10</th-code> </th-text>
							<th-content-group>
								<th-text>
									Fixed attributes-as-properties binding, which set attributes prematurely, causing issues with
									reactivity. The attributes are now set after the element is connected to the DOM. Additionally, more
									protection against infinite loops has been added.
								</th-text>
							</th-content-group>
						</th-content-group>
					</li>
					<li>
						<th-content-group>
							<th-text> <th-code>2.3.9</th-code> </th-text>
							<th-content-group>
								<th-text>
									Patched recursive issues and enhanced debug features. Signals now perform a deep equivalence check on
									objects to avoid excessive calls.
								</th-text>
							</th-content-group>
						</th-content-group>
					</li>
					<li>
						<th-content-group>
							<th-text> <th-code>2.3.8</th-code> </th-text>
							<th-content-group>
								<th-text> Fixed minor problems with debug logging for signals. </th-text>
							</th-content-group>
						</th-content-group>
					</li>
					<li>
						<th-content-group>
							<th-text> <th-code>2.3.7</th-code> </th-text>
							<th-content-group>
								<th-text>
									Removed batch updates for signals altogether, as asynchronous updates were creating multiple issues,
									and the performance impact is negligible. Signals are now updated immediately.
								</th-text>
							</th-content-group>
						</th-content-group>
					</li>
					<li>
						<th-content-group>
							<th-text> <th-code>2.3.6</th-code> </th-text>
							<th-content-group>
								<th-text>
									Fixed the attribute binding, which was recently broken by another fix that prevented attributes from
									being modified while iterating them. Instead of using a queue, the list of attributes is now cloned
									for iteration, because the updates must occur in effects to properly bind the signals.
								</th-text>
							</th-content-group>
						</th-content-group>
					</li>
					<li>
						<th-content-group>
							<th-text> <th-code>2.3.5</th-code> </th-text>
							<th-content-group>
								<th-text>
									Fixed issues with signal batching, where new updates triggered by the existing batch were not being
									called properly.
								</th-text>
							</th-content-group>
						</th-content-group>
					</li>
					<li>
						<th-content-group>
							<th-text> <th-code>2.3.4</th-code> </th-text>
							<th-content-group>
								<th-text>
									Fixed issues with `prop:` binding when using multiple properties, and when the template continued
									parsing empty text after a signal was already captured.
								</th-text>
							</th-content-group>
						</th-content-group>
					</li>
					<li>
						<th-content-group>
							<th-text> <th-code>2.3.3</th-code> </th-text>
							<th-content-group>
								<th-text>
									Fixed mapped types for props to ensure the signals would always be defined, but the values may be
									undefined.
								</th-text>
							</th-content-group>
						</th-content-group>
					</li>
					<li>
						<th-content-group>
							<th-text> <th-code>2.3.2</th-code> </th-text>
							<th-content-group>
								<th-text>
									Fixed edge cases where the custom elements would not upgrade before properties were bound.
								</th-text>
							</th-content-group>
						</th-content-group>
					</li>
					<li>
						<th-content-group>
							<th-text> <th-code>2.3.0</th-code> </th-text>
							<th-content-group>
								<th-text>
									Added HTMLCustomElement type for convenience.
									<th-link href="/docs/types">Read more about types.</th-link>
								</th-text>
							</th-content-group>
						</th-content-group>
					</li>
					<li>
						<th-content-group>
							<th-text> <th-code>2.2.0</th-code> </th-text>
							<th-content-group>
								<th-text> Added property signal initializers. For example: </th-text>
								<th-code>const [prop, setProp] = propSignals.prop.init('initial')</th-code>
								<th-link href="/docs/property-signals">Read more about properties.</th-link>
							</th-content-group>
						</th-content-group>
					</li>
					<li>
						<th-content-group>
							<th-text> <th-code>2.1.1</th-code> </th-text>
							<th-text> Enhanced logging for all errors to avoid silent failures. </th-text>
						</th-content-group>
					</li>
					<li>
						<th-content-group>
							<th-text> <th-code>2.1.0</th-code> </th-text>

					<li>
						<th-content-group>
							<th-text> <th-code>2.0.8</th-code> </th-text>

								place in the DOM.
							</th-text>
						</th-content-group>
					</li>
					<li>
						<th-content-group>
							<th-text> <th-code>2.0.7</th-code> </th-text>
