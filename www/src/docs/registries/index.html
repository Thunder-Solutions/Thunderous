					The <th-code>createRegistry()</th-code> function is used to create a registry for custom elements, which
					returns a <th-code>RegistryResult</th-code> with some helpful methods and properties. These registries may be
					global or scoped. Global registries allow you to track how custom elements are defined by the consumers of
					your code.
				</th-text>
				<ul>

							<th-text>
								<th-code>RegistryResult.define()</th-code> is functionally equivalent to the native
								<th-code>customElements.define()</th-code> method, with the added benefits of Thunderous registries.
							</th-text>
							<th-text>
								In case you want to delegate custom element definitions to the consumer of your library, it's better to
								use the <th-code>ElementResult.register()</th-code> method, which defers tag name definitions until
								<th-code>ElementResult.define()</th-code> is called.

					<li>
						<th-content-group>
							<th-text>
								<th-code>RegistryResult.getTagName()</th-code> returns the tag name of the custom element associated
								with the provided class. This can be useful when you need to select a custom element whose tag name is
								variable.
							</th-text>
							<th-code-block lang="ts"><%= include('_code-snippets/registry-tag-name.ejs') %></th-code-block>
						</th-content-group>
					</li>
					<li>
						<th-code>RegistryResult.getAllTagNames()</th-code> returns an array of all the tag names in the registry.
					</li>
					<li>
						<th-code>RegistryResult.eject()</th-code> returns the native
						<th-code>CustomElementRegistry</th-code> instance that the registry is using. If the registry was not
						scoped, this will return the global <th-code>customElements</th-code> object.
					</li>
					<li>
						<th-content-group>
							<th-text>
								<th-code>RegistryResult.scoped</th-code> is a boolean that indicates whether the registry is scoped. To
								create a scoped registry, pass <th-code>scoped: true</th-code> to the arguments of
								<th-code>createRegistry()</th-code>. This allows you to support the proposed
								<th-link
									href="https://github.com/WICG/webcomponents/blob/gh-pages/proposals/Scoped-Custom-Element-Registries.md"
									>scoped custom element registries</th-link
								>, which define custom elements within the current shadow root only.

					</li>

					Scoped registries are now supported by Thunderous out of the box, using the official
					<th-link href="https://github.com/webcomponents/polyfills/tree/master/packages/scoped-custom-element-registry"
						>scoped custom elements polyfill</th-link
					>
					under the hood. This was directly included to support server-side environments where the native
					<th-code>CustomElementRegistry</th-code> is not available.
