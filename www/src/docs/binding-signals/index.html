				<th-text>
					To bind signals to a template, use the provided <th-code>html</th-code> tagged template function to pass them
					in.
				</th-text>
				<th-code-block lang="ts"><%= include('_code-snippets/binding-signals.ejs') %></th-code-block>

				<p>
					NOTICE: we are not running the signal's getter above. This is intentional, as we delegate that to the template
					to run for proper binding.
				</p>
				<p>
					By binding signals to templates, you allow fine-grained updates to be made directly to DOM nodes every time
					the signal changes, without requiring any diffing or re-rendering.
				</p>
				<p>
					This also works for <th-code>css</th-code>, but bear in mind that passing signals to a shared
					<th-code>CSSStyleSheet</th-code> may not have the effect you expect. Sharing Style Sheets across many
					component instances is best for performance, but signals will update every instance of each component with
					that approach. The suggested alternative is to write static CSS and toggle classes in the HTML instead.
