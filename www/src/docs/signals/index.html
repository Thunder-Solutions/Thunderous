				<th-text>
					Signals are the new hot way to manage reactive state in your application. Combined with effects, they behave
					similarly to observables, but subscribers are added automatically with each effect. Unlike traditional state,
					where everything must run again using the new state, signals only trigger the effects that depend on them.
					This way, you can make fine-grained updates directly, rather than incurring the cost of re-rendering
					everything.
