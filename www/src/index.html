					<h2>Why Thunderous?</h2>
					<th-text>
						<p>
							Unlike web component frameworks, the Thunderous library doesn't impose a particular approach to building
							entire applications. Instead, it provides a set of tools to help you build interoperable web components
							that can be used in any framework or vanilla JavaScript.
						</p>
						<p>
							Thunderous works best for building component libraries as design systems. Components may be distributed
							through standalone packages to be consumed by multiple projects. It's designed to be agnostic, flexible,
							and performant.
						</p>
						<p>
							The biggest advantage Thunderous provides over similar libraries is its "render-once" approach and
							fine-grained reactivity; signals bind to templates and apply changes directly where needed. Putting aside
							the performance benefits, this approach also avoids the complexity and cognitive burden of additional
							lifecycle methods. It's a more natural way to write JavaScript.
						</p>

					<h2>Why Functions?</h2>
					<p>In short - the class syntax in JavaScript is verbose and error-prone.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>There's a lot of boilerplate code to write</li>
						<li>Methods are in danger of losing their binding context</li>
						<li>Repetition is usually necessary for each method's scope</li>
						<li>Encapsulation tends to be weaker in classes than in closures</li>
						<li>Functions are more concise and easier to reason about</li>
					</ul>
