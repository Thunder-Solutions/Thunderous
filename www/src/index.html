				<h2>Why Thunderous?</h2>
				<th-text>
					<p>
						Unlike similar packages, Thunderous doesn't impose a particular approach to building entire applications.
						Instead, it provides a set of tools to help you build interoperable web components that can be used in any
						framework or vanilla JavaScript.
					</p>
					<p>
						Its greatest strength lies in building component libraries as design systems, where components can be
						distributed as part of standalone packages which can be consumed by multiple projects. It's designed to be
						agnostic, flexible, and performant.
