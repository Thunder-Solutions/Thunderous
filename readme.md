# THUNDEROUS

## A JavaScript library for defining native web components in a functional way

Thunderous started as a playful experiment to try and make defining web components a little bit quicker and easier. The usual syntax can be daunting and repetitive, and there are limited features out of the box. After becoming familiar with React projects, this idea was revisited to create a more functional approach, and then one thing led to another until it wound up as a full project worth its own repository.

This is still a work-in-progress, but to learn a bit about how it works, take a look at the demo folder. You can run a local server with `npm start` to see it in action.
